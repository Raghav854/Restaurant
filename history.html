                <h2>We begin our story a long time ago so fasten your seat belts for a whistle stop tour of ramen history! It starts in 1800s China, which is considered to be the birthplace of all things ramen. The idea of noodles in a soupy broth travelled with Chinese immigrants in the late 19th or early 20th Century to Japan after the Meijiichin [Meiji Restoration] in 1868. On arriving in Japan Chinatowns sprung up like the one in Yokohama - a busy port town that helped to spread the popularity of ramen throughout Japan.</h2>

                    <h2>Then in 1947 Fukuoka, the now world famous Hakata tonkotsu Ramen was actually made by sheer mistake! Restaurant chefs when they over boiled the soup, made the pork broth extra milky and white. But on tasting it they realised they were on to a good thing - and Hakata tonkotsu broth was born.<br><br> Regional variations of ramen started to spring up with the first being Ajino Sanpei 味の三平 in Sapporo, Hokkaido in the north of Japan, the first ramen bar to create miso ramen - now synonymous with Hokkaido just as much as the snowboarding.</h2>

                    <h2>Onwards to post war Japan, bread and wheat consumption increased, with wheat being made into ramen noodles. By 1950 ramen noodles were increasingly being eaten at outdoor street stalls known as yatai that started to spring up across towns and cities offering workers a quick hot meal at all hours of the day and night.<br><br>In 1958, a key milestone for ramen fans was the invention of instant noodles by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-Japanese founder of Nissin Foods. This allowed anyone to make this comfort soul food at home in just a few easy steps.</h2>
